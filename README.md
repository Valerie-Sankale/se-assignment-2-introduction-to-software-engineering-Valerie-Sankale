Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is a systematic approach to developing, operating, maintaining and retirement of a software.
    Examples of software engineering in action is development of a large scale e-commerce platform like Amazon. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a structured and methodolical approach to software development from conception all the way to maintenance; while traditional programming involves writing codes to solve specific problems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

    Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process used in software development.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Planning
    This is the first phase of software development that involves identifying the scope and objectives of the project.
             e.g project planning, risk analysis and resource allocation.

Requirement Gathering and Analysis
    This phase ensures that software developers and stakeholders have a clear understadning of project requirements.
            Activities involved here are requirements gathering, documentation and validation. These can be done through intevriews with user departments or surveys.

Design
    This phase transforms gathered requirements into detailed specifications for building the software.
        Examples; architecture design, user interface design, database design.

Implementation
    Design specifications are translated into executable software by writting codes based on design documents. Here programming languages are used.

Testing
The softwae is rigorously tested to ensure its free of defects and bugs. 
    Examples; system testing, user acceptance testing.

Deployment
    The system is made operational and deployed to users.
        Activities include; installation, configuration and training of users.

Maintenance
    Phase entails correcting issues to improve performance
        E.g by bug fixing, system updates, optimization.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Waterfall Model:
    The waterfall model uses a sequential approach where each phase must be completed befor the next begins. 

        Ideal scenarions:
            Preffered for regulated industries, that require extensive documentation and a clear audit trail.
            Ideal for short term projects with limited scope.
            Ideal for projects with stable requirements.
Agile Model:
    Development is carried out in small, iterative cycles. Agile model involves constant feedback and change of requirements from stakeholders and end-users.
    Software is developed and released incrementally, providing working versions of the product at the end of each iteration. 

        Ideal scenarions:
            Preffered for projects where requirements are expected to change over time.
            Ideal for long term projects.
            Ideal for projects requiring user feedback

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

    Requirements engineering:
        Involves the systematic process of defining and documenting systems requirements to ensure that the final software product meets user specifications

    Requirements engineering process:
        Requirements gathering from stakeholders e.g through surveys, questionnaires,and document analysis. 
        Requirements analysis is the done to identify conflicts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. 
        The requirement specifications are the documented in clear and concise manner.
        The requirements are then validated. Techniques such as reviews and test case generation are used to validate the requirements.
        Requirements are then managed through tracking and controlling changes to the requirements, ensuring that all modifications are properly documented and communicated.

    Importance of requirements engineering:
        Reducing the risk of project failure due to unmet requirements.
        Reduces development costs and time by identifying and solving issues as they arise.
        Enhances quality and user satisfaction since requirements are clear and validated on time.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

    Modularity:
        Modularity refers to the practice of dividing a software system modules or units for fater execution and easy debugging of the program.
    Importance of modularity:
        Individual modules can be tested in isolation, making it easier to identify and fix defects. 
        Teams can work on different modules concurrently without causing integration issues. 


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

    Unit testing:
        Focuses on testing individual components or units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation from the rest of the application.
    Integration testing:
        Involves testing the interactions between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as intended.
    System testing:
        Entails testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
    Acceptance testing:
        Is the final level of testing, performed to determine whether the software is ready for delivery. It verifies that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the user.

    Testing is crucial in software development because it identifies and rectifies errors early, improves software quality and minimizes risk of software failure.
    
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

    Version control systems are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They track revisions, enable collaboration among multiple developers, and maintain a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.

        Examples: 
        Git: known for its speed, flexibility, and robust branching and merging capabilities. 
        Subversion: has atomic commits and tracks changes to the entire directory structure.
        Mercurial: Known for its ease of use and straightforward command set and has high perfomance for large projects.
